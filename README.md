## Description of Approach

* **Scalability and Reusability:** The components were designed with scalability in mind, making them easily reusable and extendable for different projects or feature additions.

* **TypeScript for Strong Typing:** Leveraged TypeScript interfaces and types to ensure type safety, improve code clarity, and provide better developer experience.

* **Component Variants and States:** For `InputField`, multiple variants (`filled`, `outlined`, `ghost`), sizes, and states like `disabled`, `invalid`, and `loading` were implemented to cover diverse UI needs.

* **Accessibility:** Added basic ARIA attributes and roles to ensure components are accessible, including labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation support.

* **Responsive Design:** Used TailwindCSSâ€™s utility classes to make components responsive and visually consistent across different screen sizes.

* **Storybook Documentation:** Documented all component variants, states, and usage examples in Storybook, enabling easy exploration and testing.

* **Testing:** Added basic unit tests to verify critical functionality and edge cases for both components.

* **Optional Features:** Included optional enhancements like clear button and password toggle in `InputField`, and single/multiple row selection in `DataTable` for improved user experience.
